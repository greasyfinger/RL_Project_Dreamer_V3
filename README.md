# RL Final Project - Dreamer V3

This is the repository with relevent code files for the submission of group 17 - "Mastering Diverse Domains through World Models - DreamerV3"

In this project we run and verify the dreamer V3 alogrithm and architechture proposed by [Hafner et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04104)

We run the algorithm for atari-MsPacman to verify existing results as well as FlappyBird, to verify performance on other relevent environments, comparing it to results from the PPO algorithm and a domain specific IRIS
